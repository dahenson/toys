# Bulb

A tiny cli for calculating the cost of running bulbs in a light fixture and
determining their potential lifespan.

## Motivation

I recently had an LED light bulb stop working in one of my fixtures. I thought
the bulb had failed prematurely, but after some rough estimates and
calculations I realized that the bulb was past its projected lifespan. This
caused me to re-evaluate some of my lighting fixtures and the bulbs I had in
them.

This utility helped me realize how much money I could save just by turning
some fixtures off, or swapping out incandescents for LEDs. It also helps
me estimate how long I can expect bulbs in a fixture to last before they
need to be replaced.

## Building

Simply run `make`.

## Usage

Run `./bulb -h` to see the usage message.
